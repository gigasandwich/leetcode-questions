Script that fetches and exports leetcode questions into a `SINGLE` pdf file (and txt  for debugging)\n
Just run `run.py`

# Dependency installation
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 fpdf
```

Note: I add another pdf from [this repo](https://github.com/shubham409/Leet-Code-Questions-In-PDF) for comparison
